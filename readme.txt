Group 2: timeseriesDISCOVERy Final Project Presentation

This project focuses on traffic pattern analysis and aims to forecast future traffic congestion levels at specific road junctions using over 48,000 historical observations.

Team Members:
- Madeleine Roberts
- Mehul Gupta
- Andrew Park

Overview:
The presentation explores the application of various time series models to analyze and predict traffic patterns:
- SARIMA: Extends ARIMA to incorporate seasonal trends, proving effective in analyzing predictable fluctuations.
- Regression with ARIMA Errors: Combines regression analysis and ARIMA, improving predictions by incorporating linear relationships.
- STL with Multiple Seasonal Periods: Decomposes time series data, accommodating multiple seasonal patterns and enhancing the understanding of long-term trends and seasonal variations.

Key Components:
- Problem Statement: Addresses the need for efficient traffic flow management to reduce delays, emissions, and enhance transportation efficiency.
- Data Analysis: Includes statistical testing and anomaly detection to prepare the data for modeling.
- Model Comparisons: Evaluates three different modeling approaches based on their performance metrics like RMSE and AIC.
- Results and Discussion: Details the performance of each model at different junctions, highlighting the best models for specific conditions.

Files:
- PowerPoint Presentation: Detailed slides explaining the methodology, data analysis, model comparisons, and results.
- Python and R Notebook and HTML: Contains the code to support the visuals and claims made in the PowerPoint.

Tools and Technologies:
- Statistical Analysis: Utilized Python and R libraries for data manipulation and statistical modeling.
- Data Visualization: Graphical representation of trends and seasonalities in traffic data.

Future Work:
- Incorporate real-time data capture to enhance model responsiveness and accuracy.
- Explore advanced machine learning models to refine the prediction capabilities further.
